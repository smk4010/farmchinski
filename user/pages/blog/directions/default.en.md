## From 81 North: Exit 211 (Lenox) – NOT LENOXVILLE. 

Turn left off the ramp. Go to the blinking light and take a right on to 92. You will see a Pump & Pantry there – you may want to get gas if you are running low. Follow 92 until Gelatt. On the right hand side you will see American Car Care Center/Burman’s Collision Center. (There is about 15 minutes of driving from 81 to this turn. Before the turn, you will see Gibson Grange on the left)
Take the right immediately after the Collision Center – it has a blue tin roof. Follow that road for about 1/4 mile and take the first right on to the first paved road. You will see a sign that says Fiddle Lake 2 miles. (It’s actually more than two miles though I think.)

Follow this road all the way up the long hill. When you reach the top, there is a fork in the road. Stay to the left/straight. Keep going a little ways and you will see the lake cottages on the right. Continue past the lake and pass East Shore Drive dirt road on the right. We are the next farm on the left. There’s a sign down by the road and the house is set back.

## From 81 South: Exit 223 (New Milford)

Turn right off the ramp on to 492 headed toward 92. At the intersection in Jackson, turn right on 92.

Turn left in Gelatt before Burman’s Collision/American Car Care Center. (It has a blue tin roof.) Follow that road for about 1/4 mile and take the first right on to the first paved road. You will see a sign that says Fiddle Lake 2 miles. Follow this road all the way up the long hill. When you reach the top, there is a fork in the road. Stay to the left/straight.

Keep going a little ways and you will see the lake cottages on the right. Continue past the lake and pass East Shore Drive dirt road on the right. We are the next farm on the left. There’s a sign down by the road and the house is set back.

## From Elk Mountain: 

Take a right out of the parking lot. Go down Rt. 374 until you get to a T in the road. Turn left (there is a white farmhouse on your right) here. This is State Road 2077. You will pass Elk Meadows on your right. If you pass Stone Bridge on the right, you went the wrong direction. Continue past Elk Meadows to the four way stop sign at Dimock Corners. Go straight through the stop sign. Continue on this road. Pass the sign that says Camp Chen-A-Wanda on the right. Take a right on to Fiddle Lake Road when you get to the end at the stop sign. There is a deserted old house in front of you.

Keep going a little ways and you will see the lake cottages on the right. Continue past the lake and pass East Shore Drive dirt road on the right. We are the next farm on the left. There’s a sign down by the road and the house is set back.

# IMPORTANT - WHEN SETTING YOUR GPS:

### Please make sure to set your GPS navigation destination BEFORE you get off of route 81.  Once you leave the highway, you may or may not have cell phone service.  Please do not get lost in Trump-Country-Frackville-TheHillsHaveEyes-Burg.  We want to see you at the wedding, so program that GPS DUDE!
